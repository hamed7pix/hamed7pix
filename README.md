- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hamed7pix. I was born and raised in Kerman, Iran, and now I am a PhD candidate at the University of Tabriz, where I study artificial intelligence. Currently, my research and career interests provide a nexus between data science, computer vision, evolutionary algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning. I have been fortunate to be able to develop my ideas in various parts of the world through the pursuit of relevant opportunities. As well as developing my ideas, I am interested in writing papers for research projects, and I have contributed to various scientific journals and conferences. In recent years, I have been proud to have more than 80 reviews (verified in WoS) for international journals and conferences. I have extensive experience working on artificial intelligence, data science, and data analytics projects. My spare time is spent coding, becoming familiar with new technologies, and improving my skills. This includes Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Analytics, and Data Visualization. My current favourite technologies & platforms are

  Python: Kears, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, PyTorch, OpenCV

  SQL: PostgreSQL / MySQL
